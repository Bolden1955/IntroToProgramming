# Intro to Programming - Distance Learning

**To qualify for Distance Learning, students must have the explicit approval from Sheri Dover.** If you're interested in Distance Learning, please email Sheri at [sheri@pdxcodeguild.com](sheri@pdxcodeguild.com).

All students will be using the Intro to Programming [readMe](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/IntroToProgramming/blob/master/readme.md) as curriculum to the class. Below is more info for distance learners.

## Calendar Invite

After getting Sheri's approval to do Programming 101 remotely, you will receive a calendar invite containing the following details about class:

  - dates
  - times
  - [Twitch link](https://www.twitch.tv/pdxcodeguild)

## Video

We currently use [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pdxcodeguild) to live stream lectures. Live streams will start and end with class times; usually 6:30pm - 9:30pm.

## Audio

Twitch streams include audio but you might have an easier time listening with a headset.

## Support

- subscribe to get alerted when streams start
- If you find that you have a question during class, please use the chatroom feature to the right of the video.

## Homework

Homework should be turned in at the end of class via Slack ([Please see this doc on how to use Slack](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/IntroToProgramming/blob/master/slack.md)). If you need more time, the next day will be fine. Distance learners will send their homework via Slack direct message to Anthony Wallace:

- Create a new direct message
- search "Anthony Wallace"
- his profile pic is him and his pup!
